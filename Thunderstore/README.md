Things marked in bold can be edited via config. Mod supports in-game config setup via RiskOfOptions and has full BetterUI support for every item.

Mod features extensive logging of practically every in-game event related to new content, so it might spam the log a lot. There is an option to completely disable logging if you have performance issues or log sizes go out of control.

If you find any bugs send me a message on discord at **viliger#9877** or submit an issue on github. I also need help with some of the assets (Atma needs a proper model, Pizza box needs good skill icons, etc), writing proper lore and models\animation extraction from game called Super Cloudbuilt. If you want to help, let me know.

## Known issues\things
<details>

  * Some effects and sounds might not work on third client (as in not server and not client that it comes from), but as far as functionality everything should be working. 
  * Respawn Flag:
    * If MUL-T picks flag as first item, places it and then picks up item without using Retool flag converts back into the item, like if another equipment was picked up. It can be resolved by using Retool once with any equipment, at the start MUL-T has one equipment slot, until MUL-T uses Retool at least once with any equipment.
  * Chronoshift:
    * Oddly-shaped Opal doesn't reset.
    * Doesn't reset states, MUL-T won't swap back, Void Fiend won't get his energy\state, Railgunner will be scoped if she was scoped or still be overheated, etc.
    * Capitan does get his beacons back but he is hard capped to two beacons at the time in vanilla. Maybe with other mods it works I dunno.
    * Probably completely breaks custom characters that rely on buffs for states.
  * Sorcerer's Pills:
    * Cooldown reduction from Alien Head is applied after Sorcerer's Pills. For example, Commando's special has base cooldown of 9 seconds, 10 pills will bring it down to 4.5 and additional Alien Head will bring it down to 3.375. This is R2API behavior, not much I can do without not using it and even then, I think it is fine as it is.
  * Adrenaline Core:
    * Getting item back from Mithrix will not restore it's levels.

## TODO\Future things
<details>

  * Current list of modded characters that I want to have displays on: CHEF, Teslaboys, VideogameMod2 characters.
  * Redo icons. Outlines are inconsistent.
  * Fix logbook item displays. Only Chronoshift currently has "display", as in it follows what I put in the code, but it needs a lot of fixing to look good.
  * Majority of items lack lore, you are free to submit a pull request or message me directly if you want to write it.
  * New model and icon for Atma, it looks terrible
  * Proper skill icons for Pizza Box
  * Code rewrite to Chronoshift at the very least, it is very janky at the moment
  * Quest system, where you pick quests in the lobby, for a price of course (0.6.0)
  * New Survivor (0.7.0)
  * New Stage (0.8.0)
